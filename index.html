		<p>
Welcome to the website of the Bridge of Allan &amp; Logie branch of the
Scottish National Party.
We believe in Scotland being the best it can be. We campaign tirelessly
for a fairer, more just and democratic Scotland, in which our children
thrive, businesses flourish, our youth receive a world class education,
our elder members of society live with the dignity and respect they
deserve and in which every man and woman can play their part in the
worlds greatest small country.
</p>

<p>We have been active in Bridge of Allan since 1996 and thrive with a
healthy membership and a strong core of activists who take part in both
local and national campaigning. We were part of Yes Bridge of Allan and
Yes Stirling during the 2014 Referendum and we keep the independence
flame burning, ready for Indyref2.
We were heavily involved in the recent General Election campaign, and
were delighted to help our candidate, Alyn Smith, defeat the Tories and
win a resounding victory. </p>

		</section><h3 class="title">Branch Meetings</h3>
		<p>Our
branch meetings are on the second Monday of each month starting at
7.00pm. In normal times we meet in the GP room in the Allan Centre,
Fountain Road, Bridge of Allan, FK9 4AT. In these COVID days, we are
continuing our monthly meetings; at the same time on the second Monday
of each month - but online with Zoom. If you would like to attend,
please use the contact form below to find out the details from our
secretary. Meetings last an hour to an hour and half. </p>
		   <p>Routine
business is dealt with mainly by the Branch Executive, allowing
meetings to focus more on political discussion around local and
national issues. All views and opinions are welcomed and valued.
Whenever possible we have guest speakers and/or elected members
present, with talks followed by Q&amp;A sessions.</p>

<p>Our meetings are informal and friendly and we warmly welcome new
members. For those who want, there’s scope to be involved in policy
making and campaigning and the opportunity to attend constituency
meetings, assemblies and National Conferences either as a branch
delegate or as a member visitor. However, those who simply wish to be
card-carrying members to show their support for the Party are equally
welcome.</p>

    <h3 class="title">Brexit and its implications for us</h3>
    <p>On
23rd June 2016, Scotland voted overwhelmingly (62% to 38%) to remain in
the European Union.
In Stirling we voted even more emphatically to remain (67% to 33%).
Scottish voters were told they could only protect their EU citizenship
by rejecting independence in 2014.
But now, the most right-wing UK government in decades has already
dragged us out of the EU
despite the Scottish Parliament together with the Assemblies in Wales
and Northern Ireland refusing
their consent.</p>


<p>For many Scots, Brexit has shown once and for all that Scotland’s voice cannot be properly heard within the UK.</p><p>

</p><p>The UK government appears intent on the hardest of Brexits. We
are only temporarily protected
by the transition period which is due to finish in December 2020; but
the enduring relationship with the EU has still to be agreed. Important
issues including trade, tariffs and quotas need to be discussed and
finalised. A possible outcome could be a minimal free trade deal; a far
cry from the promises of the Leave campaign in 2016 and extremely
damaging for Scotland.</p>

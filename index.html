		<h3 class="title">Bridge of Allan & Logie SNP</h3>
		<p>

Welcome to the website of the Bridge of Allan & Logie branch of the Scottish National Party.
We believe in Scotland being the best it can be. We campaign tirelessly for a fairer, more just and democratic Scotland, in which our children thrive, businesses flourish, our youth receive a world class education, our elder members of society live with the dignity and respect they deserve and in which every man and woman can play their part in the worlds greatest small country.
</p>

<p>We have been active in Bridge of Allan since 1996 and thrive with a healthy membership and a strong core of activists who take part in both local and national campaigning.  We were part of Yes Bridge of Allan and Yes Stirling during the 2014 Referendum and we keep the independence flame burning, ready for Indyref2.

We were heavily involved in the recent General Election campaign, and were delighted to help our candidate, Alyn Smith, defeat the Tories and win a resounding victory. </p>

		<h3 class="title">Branch Meetings</h3>
		<p>Our branch meetings are on the second Monday of each month in the GP room in the Allan Centre, Fountain Road, Bridge of Allan, FK9 4AT starting at 7.00 p.m.  Routine business is dealt with mainly by the Branch Executive, allowing meetings to focus more on political discussion around local and national issues. All views and opinions are welcomed and valued. Whenever possible we have guest speakers and/or elected members present, with talks followed by Q&A sessions.</p>

<p>Our meetings are informal and friendly and we warmly welcome new members. For those who want, there’s scope to be involved in policy making and campaigning and the opportunity to attend constituency meetings, assemblies and National Conferences either as a branch delegate or as a member visitor.  However, those who simply wish to be card-carrying members to show their support for the Party are equally welcome.</p>
